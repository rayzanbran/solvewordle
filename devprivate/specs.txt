- solve wordle
- given any of five known letters, generate all possible alphabetical solutions
- discard strings that are not words

- wordle letter classifications:
- letters that are in the word at an unknown location
- letters that are not in the word
- letters that are in the word at a known location

data entry:
(for all of these, blank indicate unknown)
- first: enter all letters that are not in the word
- next: letter by letter, all letters that are NOT at a specified position
- next: letter by letter, all letters that ARE at a specified position


ranking??:
- rank possible solutions by letters eliminated (like wordle bot does)
- display best guesses
-- RANKING SYSTEM:
-- eliminating vowels top priority
-- after that, rank letters by the amount of times they appear in the wordle dictionary
-- add up all letters in the guess and rank by score
--- we need objects for Guesses to store the word and the score

next up: 
- sort guesses by score
- add error handling for input
- differentiate actual solutions from non-solutions that you are allowed to guess!
